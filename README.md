# Pomodoro
This is a small project I did for Appgud hackathon!
## Inspiration
The inspiration behind creating this Pomodoro website was to provide users with a simple and effective tool for managing their work and study sessions. The Pomodoro technique has proven to be a valuable productivity method, and I wanted to bring its benefits to users through a user-friendly online platform.

## What it does
The Pomodoro website functions as a timer that alternates between focused work intervals and short breaks, following the Pomodoro technique. Users can customize the duration of work and break periods according to their preferences. The website also includes features like notifications and a visual countdown to help users stay on track during their work sessions.

## How we built it
The website was built using a combination of HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the dynamic functionality. HTML provided the basic framework, CSS was employed to enhance the visual appeal and layout, while JavaScript handled the timer logic and user interactions. The use of these technologies allowed for a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development process, one of the challenges we faced was synchronizing the timer with real-time events and ensuring smooth transitions between work and break intervals. Additionally, implementing notification features and maintaining compatibility across different browsers presented its own set of challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
One of the significant accomplishments of this project is creating a user-friendly Pomodoro timer that effectively helps users manage their time and boost productivity. Overcoming challenges related to timer synchronization and ensuring a seamless user experience were particularly rewarding achievements.

## What we learned
Through the development of this Pomodoro website, we gained valuable insights into handling time-related events in JavaScript, improving user interface design with CSS, and addressing compatibility issues across various browsers. This project provided a hands-on learning experience in web development and user experience design.

## What's next for Pomodoro timer
In the future, we plan to enhance the website by incorporating additional features such as session history tracking, user accounts for personalized settings, and the ability to share progress with others. Continuous improvements and user feedback will guide the evolution of the Pomodoro timer, making it an even more effective tool for time management and productivity.
